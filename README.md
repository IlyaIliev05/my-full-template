# My Very First Project-Website

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was created for educational purposes as part of the learning material provided by 
Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

[Here](https://ilyailiev05.github.io/my-full-template/) you can take a look at my very first 
website.


# Project Description

This website was created with the purpose of helping me to get familiar with common development tools like Git,GitHub and GitPod. It also aided me at getting used to saving my code rather often as a safety first measure, building and deploying code to Git,GitHub where is it safely stored and creating a habit of writing and working with code in the GitPod platform.

# Technology

The project was written in HTML & CSS with the usage of Command-line Interface(CLI)
and Integrated Development Environment(IDE).

# Credit

All credit goes to Code Institute and how amazing their FullStack Web Developer program is in terms of how the lessons
are divided on easily assimilated information, crystal clear explanation of the modules and therefore allowing me to 
take light steps through the challenges that have been completed and those yet to come.
Thank you, [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net)
